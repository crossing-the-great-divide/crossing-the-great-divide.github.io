The whole affair happened some two years ago.</p><p>William James, the 19th century philosopher posited that in order for evolution to proceed, consciousnous was a necessary ingredient at the origin of everything. Contemporary physics, anthropology, music, and linguistics demonstrate that we live in a participatory universe and the notion of people as casual observers is illusory. The very act of creating a landscape can soon find itself occupying the space it seeks to frame. The dilemma this paradox poses for landscape painters has revealed a relationship between the landscape and the methods used to record it. In order to speak of these places, I must first start with a set of memories and then work towards the dichotomies that form their natural conclusions: such as how the notion of "wilderness" contains within it the notion of "containment" and how a reverential depiction of nature depends on technique, and this in turn reveals that I have created nature in my own image. Accordingly, I try to imbue the picture plane with what makes nature potent, mysterious and ultimately untamable while at the same time making manifest an awareness of this view of nature as a product of my own mythology.</p></div></section></body></html>
