C..</p>
<p>This work will attempt to address the interelationships between movement through the landscape under human power and the contempletive low impact space it affords. During the time of travel, I reflected on the power of a cultural icon, well being in a civil society, contemporary aesthetics, and the individual process of conceptually mapping a landscape. By retracing the route Abraham Lincoln traveled from Springfield, Illinois to Washington D.C. after he was elected, it is my intent to explore the validity of Lincoln in a contemporary figure in civil society as well as the personal mythologies I see in American history.</p></section></body></html>
