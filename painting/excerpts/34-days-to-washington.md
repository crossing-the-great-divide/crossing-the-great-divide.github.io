## 34 Days To Washington

"34 Days to Washington: Taking Measure Across the American Landscape" is a process art project involving bicycling 2034 miles from Springfield, Illinois to Washington D.C.following the meandering route that Abraham Lincoln road on his inaugural train to Washington D. C..

This work will attempt to address the interelationships between movement through the landscape under human power and the contempletive low impact space it affords. During the time of travel, I reflected on the power of a cultural icon, well being in a civil society, contemporary aesthetics, and the individual process of conceptually mapping a landscape. By retracing the route Abraham Lincoln traveled from Springfield, Illinois to Washington D.C. after he was elected, it is my intent to explore the validity of Lincoln in a contemporary figure in civil society as well as the personal mythologies I see in American history.
